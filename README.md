**WHAT IS BUFFER OVERFLOW ?** 

Buffers are memory storage regions that temporarily hold data while it is being transferred from one location to another. A buffer overflow (or buffer overrun) occurs when the volume of data exceeds the storage capacity of the memory buffer. As a result, the program attempting to write the data to the buffer overwrites adjacent memory locations.


**What is a Buffer Overflow Attack**

Attackers exploit buffer overflow issues by overwriting the memory of an application. This changes the execution path of the program, triggering a response that damages files or exposes private information. For example, an attacker may introduce extra code, sending new instructions to the application to gain access to IT systems. If attackers know the memory layout of a program, they can intentionally feed input that the buffer cannot store, and overwrite areas that hold executable code, replacing it with their own code. For example, an attacker can overwrite a pointer (an object that points to another area in memory) and point it to an exploit payload, to gain control over the program.


In my code, you can use Buffer Overflow vulnerability to exploit target machine and gain access to its directories and datas by directing External Instruction Pointer to your backdoor code.

USAGE(Example for you to try it out) : 
```
1-) Download Vulnserver and install it on the vulnerable machine
2-) Download Immunity Debugger and install it on the vulnerable machine
3-) Run both as administrator (Don't forget to restart both always when Vulnserver crashed because of our tests)
4-) In Immunity Debugger press the RUN icon above
5-) python3 fuzzing.py : run it and find out at what step it gets stuck (it gives a number in the 2000s, you can notice plus or minus, so accept 3000) (Change           fuzzing.py mySocket.connect(("YOUR TARGET MACHINE IP",9999))  11st line)
6-) Enter cd /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/ and run the code ./pattern_create.rb -l 3000 so that a hexadec text consisting of 3000 letters and           numbers is created in the terminal. Copy this and assign it to the patternCreated variables in offset.py
7-) python3 offset.py : Run and go to Immunity debugger. Get the value next to EIP in the section that says Registers (Mine was 386F4337 for example) (Change           offset.py mySocket.connect(("YOUR TARGET MACHINE IP",9999) 9th line)
8-) ./pattern_offset.rb -l 3000 -q 386F4337 : Run this code and find exactly which letter or unit it gives error
```
